# Micro-Manager PyDevice

This repository houses discussions and issues related to the PyDevice project, which enables writing Python device adapters for Micro-Manager devices. Currently, it's source code and documenation live [here](https://github.com/micro-manager/mmCoreAndDevices/tree/main/DeviceAdapters/PyDevice) within the mmCoreAndDevices repository. The [long term plan]https://github.com/micro-manager/micro-manager/issues/1392) is to eventually house device adapters in their own repositories, so the source code will be here too.

In the mean time, this repository serves as the central hub for managing and discussing issues, feature requests, and other topics related to the development and maintenance of PyDevice.

Feel free to open issues for any bugs you encounter or features you would like to see. Participate in discussions to help us improve the project.

Thank you for your contributions!
